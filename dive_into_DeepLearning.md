## 2.04 Calculus
A computer can not calculate a derivatives. Instead, a computer estimate a derivatives by numerical method.

## breif history of Deep learning
Yangqing Jia, 2013 
library decaf
library caffe (written C++) | [link](https://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/)


Google, 2014
Tensorflow (name is derived from C++ parallel library, which contains 'flow' as name), in-house library (not opened for public)

Google, 2015
Tensorflow (public version, different from in-house version)

Torch7
yann leCun
Lua : unusal, interpretor-based language, easy to learn, not-well engineered

PyTorch, 2016
New version of Torch based on Python.

**Gradient**  
autograd | [github](https://github.com/HIPS/autograd)
computation graph

chain rule allosws to calculate gradient per each layer. Next, sum up. It is backpropagation.
